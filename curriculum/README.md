### Module 1: Understanding V1 Development
**File**: `01_understanding_v1_development.md`
**Focus**: Project development process, real-world applications, and iterative improvement
**Learning Outcomes**: 
- Understand the development process that led to V1
- Connect NLP techniques to food system policy analysis
- Identify improvement opportunities

### Module 2: NLP Technical Foundations
**File**: `02_nlp_technical_foundations.md`
**Focus**: Technical concepts, library choices, and implementation decisions
**Learning Outcomes**:
- Explain NLP concepts and techniques used in V1
- Understand why specific approaches were chosen
- Apply concepts to design solutions for other domains

## Target Audience
- **Students**: Computer science, data science, public policy, or agriculture students
