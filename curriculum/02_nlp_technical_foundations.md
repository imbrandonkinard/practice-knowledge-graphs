## Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, students will be able to:
- Explain the technical concepts behind NLP libraries and techniques used in V1

- Apply NLP concepts to design solutions for other text analysis problems
- Evaluate the trade-offs between different NLP approaches

## Core NLP Concepts and Their Applications

### 1. Natural Language Processing (NLP) Fundamentals

#### What is NLP?
**Definition**: Natural Language Processing is a branch of artificial intelligence that helps computers understand, interpret, and manipulate human language.

**Why It Matters for Legislative Bills**:
- Bills contain complex legal language that needs structured interpretation
- We need to identify who, what, when, where, and how from text
- Relationships between entities must be extracted for policy analysis

#### Key NLP Tasks in Our Project
1. **Tokenization**: Breaking text into individual words and punctuation
2. **Part-of-Speech Tagging**: Identifying grammatical roles (noun, verb, adjective)
3. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Finding people, organizations, locations, dates
4. **Dependency Parsing**: Understanding relationships between words
5. **Relation Extraction**: Identifying connections between entities

### 2. Stanford CoreNLP: The Powerhouse Behind V1

#### What is Stanford CoreNLP?
**Definition**: Stanford CoreNLP is a suite of natural language analysis tools that provides state-of-the-art performance for various NLP tasks.

**Why We Chose It**:
- **Accuracy**: Industry-leading performance on standard NLP benchmarks
- **Completeness**: Provides all the NLP tools we need in one package
- **Reliability**: Well-tested and maintained by Stanford University
- **Integration**: Easy to use with Python through various interfaces

#### CoreNLP Components We Use

##### Tokenization
```python
# What it does: Breaks text into individual tokens (words, punctuation)
# Example input: "The Department of Agriculture shall establish..."
# Example output: ["The", "Department", "of", "Agriculture", "shall", "establish", "..."]

# Why it matters: 
# - Foundation for all other NLP tasks
# - Handles complex punctuation and formatting
# - Preserves text structure for analysis
```

##### Named Entity Recognition (NER)
```python
# What it does: Identifies and categorizes named entities
# Entity types we care about:
# - ORGANIZATION: "Department of Agriculture", "Hawaii Legislature"
# - PERSON: "Governor Ige", "Senator Smith"
# - LOCATION: "Hawaii", "Honolulu", "Maui County"
# - DATE: "2021", "July 1", "regular session"
# - MONEY: "$500,000", "thirty per cent"

# Why it matters for food systems:
# - Track which organizations are involved in policy
# - Identify geographic scope of regulations
# - Monitor funding amounts and timelines
```

##### Dependency Parsing
```python
# What it does: Analyzes grammatical relationships between words
# Example: "The Department shall establish a program"
# Relationships:
# - "Department" is the subject of "establish"
# - "program" is the object of "establish"
# - "The" modifies "Department"

# Why it matters:
# - Understands who does what to whom
# - Identifies policy requirements and obligations
# - Extracts actionable information from legal text
```

### 3. Text Preprocessing: The Foundation of Quality NLP

#### Why Preprocessing Matters
**Challenge**: Raw HTML text contains formatting artifacts that confuse NLP models.

**Solution**: Clean, structured text that preserves meaning while removing noise.

#### BeautifulSoup: HTML Parsing Made Simple
```python
# What it does: Parses HTML and extracts clean text
# Why BeautifulSoup:
# - Handles malformed HTML gracefully
# - Provides intuitive API for text extraction
# - Preserves document structure
# - Handles various HTML encodings

# Example transformation:
# Input: <p class="RegularParagraphs">The <strong>Department</strong> shall...</p>
# Output: "The Department shall..."
```

#### Text Cleaning Techniques
```python
# 1. Remove HTML tags: <p> → ""
# 2. Handle HTML entities: &nbsp; → " "
# 3. Normalize whitespace: "  multiple   spaces" → "multiple spaces"
# 4. Preserve structure: Keep paragraph breaks and section headers
# 5. Handle special characters: Remove or normalize unusual symbols
```

### 4. Memory Management: Processing Large Documents

#### The Challenge
**Problem**: Legislative bills can be thousands of words long, exceeding memory limits.

**Impact**: 
- CoreNLP may crash or timeout
- Processing becomes unreliable
- System resources are exhausted

#### Text Chunking Strategy
```python
# What it does: Breaks large documents into manageable pieces
# Strategy:
# 1. Split on sentence boundaries (preserve meaning)
# 2. Keep chunks under 2000 characters (CoreNLP limit)
# 3. Process chunks sequentially
# 4. Combine results for final analysis

# Why this approach:
# - Maintains sentence integrity
# - Prevents memory overflow
# - Enables processing of any document size
# - Preserves context within chunks
```

### 5. Output Structuring: From Text to Data

#### JSON: The Language of Data Exchange
```python
# What it does: Provides structured, machine-readable output
# Benefits:
# - Easy to parse and analyze
# - Human-readable format
# - Standard across programming languages
# - Supports nested data structures

# Example output structure:
{
  "entities": [
    {
      "text": "Department of Agriculture",
      "type": "ORGANIZATION",
      "start_char": 45,
      "end_char": 67,
      "confidence": 0.95
    }
  ],
  "relations": [
    {
      "subject": "Department of Agriculture",
      "predicate": "shall establish",
      "object": "farm to school program",
      "confidence": 0.87
    }
  ]
}
```
