# Version 2: High Impact - Low Effort Improvements

**Date**: August 30, 2025  
**Impact Level**: High  
**Effort Level**: Low  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete

---

## üéØ **Overview**

Version 2 implements high-impact, low-effort improvements that significantly enhance the entity and relation extraction quality while maintaining the robust architecture of v1. These improvements focus on leveraging more CoreNLP capabilities and adding domain-specific patterns.

---

## üöÄ **Enhancements Implemented**

### **1. Enhanced CoreNLP Annotators**
- **Added**: `lemma`, `openie` annotators
- **Benefits**: 
  - **Lemma**: Normalized word forms (e.g., "moves" ‚Üí "move")
  - **OpenIE**: Stanford's Open Information Extraction for additional relations
- **Impact**: Better entity normalization and more relation extraction

### **2. Custom NER Patterns for Legislative Domain**
- **New Entity Types**:
  - `PROGRAM`: Farm to School Program, coordinator program, meals program
  - `AGENCY`: Department of Education, HDOA, DOE, Legislature
  - `GOAL`: 30%, 2030, locally sourced, minimum percentage
  - `REPORTING`: Annual report, reporting requirement, submit report
  - `STATUTE`: Chapter numbers, section references, Hawaii Revised Statutes
  - `PURPOSE`: Program purposes (improve health, develop workforce, etc.)

- **Implementation**: Regex-based pattern matching with high confidence (0.9)
- **Impact**: Captures domain-specific entities that generic NER misses

### **3. Enhanced Relation Patterns for Bill-Specific Relationships**
- **New Relation Types**:
  - `PROGRAM_MOVEMENT`: Program transfers between agencies
  - `GOAL_SETTING`: Numerical targets and timelines
  - `REPORTING_REQUIREMENT`: Legislative reporting obligations
  - `COORDINATOR_ROLE`: Leadership and collaboration structures
  - `PROGRAM_PURPOSES`: The 5 specific program purposes from the bill

- **Pattern Examples**:
  ```python
  # Program purposes
  "purpose.*farm to school program.*shall be to.*improve student health"
  "purpose.*farm to school program.*shall be to.*develop.*agricultural workforce"
  "purpose.*farm to school program.*shall be to.*enrich.*local food system"
  ```

### **4. Improved Confidence Scoring**
- **Enhanced Attributes**: Added `confidence`, `relation_type`, `source` fields
- **Source Tracking**: Distinguishes between CoreNLP, patterns, OpenIE, etc.
- **Confidence Levels**: 
  - Pattern matches: 0.9
  - Dependency parse: 0.6-0.8
  - OpenIE: 0.7 (default)

### **5. OpenIE Integration**
- **New Source**: Stanford's Open Information Extraction
- **Benefits**: Captures relations that dependency parsing might miss
- **Integration**: Seamlessly merged with other extraction methods

## üîß **Technical Implementation**

### **New Classes Added**

#### **LegislativeNERPatterns**
```python
class LegislativeNERPatterns:
    """Custom NER patterns for legislative domain"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.patterns = {
            "PROGRAM": [r"farm to school program", ...],
            "AGENCY": [r"department of education", ...],
            # ... more patterns
        }
    
    def extract_custom_entities(self, text: str) -> List[CoreNLPEntity]:
        """Extract entities using custom legislative patterns"""
```

#### **EnhancedRelationPatterns**
```python
class EnhancedRelationPatterns:
    """Enhanced relation patterns for bill-specific relationships"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.patterns = {
            "PROGRAM_PURPOSES": [
                (pattern, rel_type, subject, predicate, obj, obj2),
                # ... more patterns
            ]
        }
```

### **Enhanced Data Structures**

#### **CoreNLPEntity**
```python
@dataclass
class CoreNLPEntity:
    text: str
    type: str
    start_char: int
    end_char: int
    ner: str
    normalized_ner: str = None
    confidence: float = 1.0          # NEW: Confidence scoring
    context: str = None              # NEW: Context information
```

#### **CoreNLPRelation**
```python
@dataclass
class CoreNLPRelation:
    subject: str
    predicate: str
    object: str
    confidence: float
    context: str
    relation_type: str = None        # NEW: Categorized relation types
    source: str = "corenlp"         # NEW: Source of extraction
```

## üìä **Expected Quality Improvements**

### **Entity Extraction**
- **Count**: +15-25 entities (domain-specific terms)
- **Types**: +6 new entity types (PROGRAM, AGENCY, GOAL, etc.)
- **Quality**: +1.0/10 (better classification and context)
- **Coverage**: +10-15% (captures legislative-specific entities)

### **Relation Extraction**
- **Count**: +8-15 relations (more patterns and OpenIE)
- **Types**: +5 new relation types (PROGRAM_PURPOSES, etc.)
- **Quality**: +1.5/10 (more meaningful relationships)
- **Relevance**: +20% (domain-specific patterns)

### **System Performance**
- **Processing Speed**: +10-15% (better annotator efficiency)

## üß™ **Testing and Validation**

### **Test Commands**
```bash
# Test enhanced CoreNLP extraction
python entity_relation_extraction_v2.py

# Test enhanced patterns only
python entity_relation_extraction_v2.py --patterns

# Test memory-efficient mode
python entity_relation_extraction_v2.py --memory-efficient

# Fast mode (patterns only)
python entity_relation_extraction_v2.py --fast
