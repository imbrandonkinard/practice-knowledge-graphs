# Version 5: High Impact - High Effort

## Next Steps (Planned)
- Train domain-adapted NER/RE models (transformers) on legislative + food systems corpora
- Add entity linking to external KGs (e.g., Wikidata, USDA datasets)
- Implement provenance tracking (docId, sentence, extractor) with SHACL validation
- Incremental processing pipeline + caching for large corpora
- Interactive annotation loop for pattern/model refinement
