# Version 3.0.1 Enhancement Analysis

**Date**: September 3, 2025  
**Enhancement Level**: Manual Annotation Integration  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete  
**Based on**: 8 manual annotations from interactive classification interface

---

## üéØ **Overview**

Version 3.0.1 represents a significant enhancement to the v3 model by incorporating insights from manual entity classification. This version demonstrates the power of human-in-the-loop annotation to identify previously missed entities and improve extraction accuracy.

---

## üìä **Manual Annotation Insights**

### **Annotations Analyzed**
Based on the interactive classification interface, 8 key entities were manually identified:

1. **HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES** ‚Üí `agency`
2. **THIRTY-FIRST LEGISLATURE, 2021** ‚Üí `Session Identifier`
3. **public schools** ‚Üí `Location - Institution`
4. **schools** ‚Üí `Location - Institution`
5. **students** ‚Üí `person`
6. **minimize diet-related diseases in childhood** ‚Üí `goal`
7. **¬ß302A** ‚Üí `legal - Section`
8. **agricultural communities** ‚Üí `Interest group`

### **Key Insights from Manual Classification**

#### **1. Missing Entity Types**
- **LEGISLATIVE_BODY**: "HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES" was not captured as a distinct legislative entity
- **SESSION_IDENTIFIER**: Session information like "THIRTY-FIRST LEGISLATURE, 2021" was missed
- **LOCATION**: Educational institutions like "public schools" and "schools" were not recognized
- **PERSON**: Individual actors like "students" were overlooked
- **INTEREST_GROUP**: Community groups like "agricultural communities" were not identified
- **HEALTH_GOAL**: Complex health objectives were not captured as distinct entities
- **LEGAL_SECTION**: Specific legal section references like "¬ß302A" needed better recognition

#### **2. Hierarchical Relationships**
- **Location Hierarchy**: "public schools" as a subset of "schools"
- **Legal Hierarchy**: "¬ß302A" as a specific section within legal references
- **Community Structure**: "agricultural communities" as collections of individual farmers

#### **3. Context Awareness**
- **Health Context**: "minimize diet-related diseases in childhood" requires understanding of health policy goals
- **Institutional Context**: "public schools" vs generic "schools" distinction
- **Temporal Context**: Session identifiers with specific years
