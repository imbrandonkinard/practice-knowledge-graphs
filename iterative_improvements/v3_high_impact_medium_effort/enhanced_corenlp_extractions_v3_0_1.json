The legislature finds that a key reason for the creation of the Hawaii farm to school program in 2015 was to improve the health of the State's keiki by encouraging consumption of fresh, locally grown foods, both for their nutritional content and to promote healthy behaviors at an early age.\nThe legislature further finds that setting a target goal of providing a fixed minimum percentage of locally sourced food in public schools can bring the farm to school program closer to achieving tangible results for the health of Hawaii's students, including an increased consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables and the potential to minimize diet-related diseases in childhood, such as obesity and diabetes.\nThe purpose of this Act is to move the Hawaii farm to school program from the department of agriculture to the department of education and establish a programmatic goal that at least thirty per cent of food served in public schools be locally sourced by 2030.\nSECTION 2. Chapter 302A, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding two new sections to subpart C of part II to be appropriately designated and to read as follows:\n\"ยง302A- Hawaii farm to school program; farm to school coordinator.

(a) By 2030, the department shall meet the local farm to school meal goal that thirty per cent of food served in public schools shall consist of locally sourced products, as measured by the percentage of the total cost of food.\n(b) The department shall submit an annual report to the legislature no later than twenty days prior to the convening of each regular session, beginning with the regular session of 2022, containing the following information:\n(1) The status of the department's progress in meeting the local farm to school meal goal;\n(2) The percentage of food served in public schools that consists of locally sourced products, by county, as measured by the percentage of the total cost of food;\n(3) The costs associated with the farm to school meals program and any savings realized;\n(4) A list of all large purchases of locally sourced products and the identity of the seller;\n(5) A list of meals on a school menu consisting of the largest percentage of locally sourced products, as measured by the percentage of the total cost of food;\n(6) The percentage of fresh food served, by county, as measured by the percentage of the total cost of food;\n(7) The percentage of processed food served, by county, as measured by the percentage of the total cost of food;\n(8) A description of the training conducted to prepare cafeteria staff for cooking meals from scratch; and\n(9) The percentage of locally sourced products purchased from the department's largest distributors, as measured by the percentage of the total cost of food.\n(c) For the purposes of this section:\n\"Fresh local agricultural products\" means fruits, vegetables, nuts, coffee, eggs, poultry and poultry products, livestock and livestock products, milk and milk products, aquacultural and maricultural products, and horticultural products that are one hundred per cent grown, raised, and harvested in Hawaii.\n\"Local value-added processed, agricultural, or food products\" means at least fifty-one per cent of the product's primary agricultural product shall be grown, raised, and harvested in Hawaii.\n\"Locally sourced products\" means fresh local agricultural products or local value-added processed, agricultural, or food products.\n\"Primary agricultural product\" means the major agricultural product in a processed or value-added agricultural or food product.\"\nSECTION 3.
