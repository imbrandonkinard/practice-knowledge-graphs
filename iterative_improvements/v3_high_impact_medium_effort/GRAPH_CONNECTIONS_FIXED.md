# Graph Connections Fixed - SB666 Integration

## Problem Identified
The SB666 bill was isolated in the ontology - it had its own entity classes and individuals but was not connected to them through proper relationships, making the knowledge graph incomplete.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. SB666 Bill Connections
**Added direct references from SB666 to its entities:**
- `SB666` → `references` → `UniversityOfHawaii`
- `SB666` → `references` → `CTAHR`
- `SB666` → `references` → `CooperativeExtension`
- `SB666` → `references` → `AgricultureEducation`
- `SB666` → `references` → `TrainingForAgricultureEducators`
- `SB666` → `references` → `ExtensionAgents`
- `SB666` → `references` → `SR80_2015`
- `SB666` → `references` → `AverageFarmerAgeStat`

### 2. Bill Package Integration
**Added SB666 to legislative package:**
- `SB666` → `partOfPackage` → `AgricultureEducationPackage`
- Created new package: `AgricultureEducationPackage` (Agriculture Education 2025 Package)

### 3. Entity-to-Entity Relationships
**Added hierarchical and functional relationships:**
- `CTAHR` → `partOf` → `UniversityOfHawaii`
- `CooperativeExtension` → `partOf` → `CTAHR`
- `TrainingForAgricultureEducators` → `relatesTo` → `AgricultureEducation`
- `ExtensionAgents` → `worksFor` → `CooperativeExtension`
- `SR80_2015` → `referencesBill` → `SB666`

### 4. New Object Properties Added
- `partOf`: Relates entities that are part of other entities
- `relatesTo`: General relationship between related entities
- `worksFor`: Relates persons to organizations they work for

### 5. Enhanced Bill Metadata
**Added missing metadata to SB666:**
- `hasBillYear`: "2025"
- `hasMeasureVersion`: "S.D. 1"

## Result
The knowledge graph now properly connects:
- **SB666** to all its extracted entities through `references` relationships
- **SB666** to its legislative package through `partOfPackage`
- **SB666 entities** to each other through hierarchical and functional relationships
- **Cross-bill references** (S.R. No. 80 references SB666)

## Graph Structure Now Includes
```
SB666 (Bill)
├── references → UniversityOfHawaii (Organization)
│   └── partOf ← CTAHR (Organization)
│       └── partOf ← CooperativeExtension (Organization)
│           └── worksFor ← ExtensionAgents (Profession)
├── references → AgricultureEducation (EducationTopic)
│   └── relatesTo ← TrainingForAgricultureEducators (TrainingAction)
├── references → SR80_2015 (LegislativeMeasure)
│   └── referencesBill → SB666 (circular reference)
└── references → AverageFarmerAgeStat (AgeStatistic)

SB666 → partOfPackage → AgricultureEducationPackage
```

The ontology now forms a connected knowledge graph where SB666 is properly integrated with its entities and relationships, making it queryable and semantically meaningful.
