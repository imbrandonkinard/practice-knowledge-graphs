# Combined Ontology Update Summary

## Overview
Updated the combined legislative bills ontology to include the improved NER extractions from SB666, incorporating new entity types and dynamic processing of all three bills (HB767, SB2182, SB666).

## Key Changes

### 1. Dynamic Ontology Generation
- **Before**: Static template-based ontology generator
- **After**: Dynamic generator that processes actual JSON extraction data from all three bills
- **File**: `combined_ontology_generator_threeBills_dynamic.py`

### 2. New Entity Types Added
The following new entity types were added based on SB666's enhanced NER patterns:

- **PROFESSION**: Occupational roles (farmer, agriculture educator, extension agent, food producers)
- **ORGANIZATION**: Organizations and institutions (University of Hawaii, CTAHR, Cooperative Extension, FFA)
- **EDUCATION_TOPIC**: Educational subjects (agriculture education, food systems education, CTE pathways)
- **TRAINING_ACTION**: Training activities (reduced training, new farmer programs, teacher training)
- **LEGISLATIVE_MEASURE**: Legislative measures (S.R. No. 80 (2015), S.B. No. 666)
- **AGE_STAT**: Age-related statistics (average farmer age, demographic data)

### 3. Ontology Statistics
- **Total Entity Types**: 23 (up from 18)
- **Total Entities**: 145 (dynamically extracted from all bills)
- **Object Properties**: 12
- **Data Properties**: 8
- **Bill Individuals**: HB767, SB2182, SB666

### 5. SB666-Specific Entities Included
The ontology now includes representative examples of SB666 entities:

**Professions:**
- average farmer
- farmer
- farmers
- agriculture educators
- agriculture educator
- extension agents
- food producers
- food systems professionals

**Organizations:**
- University of Hawaii
- University of Hawaii at Manoa
- College of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resilience
- Cooperative Extension
- CTAHR
- FFA (Future Farmers of America)

**Education Topics:**
- agriculture education
- food systems education
- career and technical education pathway
- higher education programs
- apprenticeships
- work-based learning programs

**Training Actions:**
- reduced training for agriculture educators
- training for agriculture educators
- teachers trained in agriculture and food systems education
- new farmer training programs

**Legislative Measures:**
- S.R. No. 80 (2015)
- S.B. No. 666

**Age Statistics:**
- average farmer in Hawaii is sixty years old
- average age of farmers

## Files Updated
1. `combined_ontology_generator_threeBills_dynamic.py` - New dynamic generator
2. `combined_legislative_bills_ontology_threeBills.owl` - Updated combined ontology
3. `ONTOLOGY_UPDATE_SUMMARY.md` - This summary document

## Benefits
1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: All three bills' entities are now included
2. **Dynamic Processing**: Ontology automatically updates when extraction data changes
3. **Rich Entity Types**: New granular entity types capture domain-specific concepts
4. **Cross-Bill Relationships**: Shared entities between bills are properly identified
5. **Metadata Preservation**: Confidence scores, context, and source information maintained

## Next Steps
- The ontology can be further enhanced with relationship extraction
- Additional bills can be easily added using the dynamic generator
- Entity canonicalization can be improved to merge similar entities across bills
