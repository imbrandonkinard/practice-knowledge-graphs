### Section 1: Legislative Findings

> **HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES**  
> **H.B. NO. 767**  
> **THIRTY-FIRST LEGISLATURE, 2021**  
> **H.D. 2**  
> **STATE OF HAWAII**  
> **S.D. 2**  
> **A BILL FOR AN ACT**  
> **RELATING TO THE ðŸ”µ FARM TO SCHOOL PROGRAM.**  
> **BE IT ENACTED BY THE ðŸŸ¢ LEGISLATURE OF THE ðŸŸ¢ STATE OF HAWAII:**

**SECTION 1.** The ðŸŸ¢ legislature finds that a key reason for the creation of the Hawaii ðŸ”µ farm to school program in 2015 was to ðŸ”´ improve the health of the State's keiki by encouraging consumption of fresh, ðŸŸ¡ locally grown foods, both for their nutritional content and to promote healthy behaviors at an early age.

The ðŸŸ¢ legislature further finds that setting a target goal of providing a fixed ðŸŸ¡ minimum percentage of ðŸŸ¡ locally sourced food in public schools can bring the ðŸ”µ farm to school program closer to achieving tangible results for the health of Hawaii's students, including an increased consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables and the potential to minimize diet-related diseases in childhood, such as obesity and diabetes.

The purpose of this Act is to move the Hawaii ðŸ”µ farm to school program from the ðŸŸ¢ department of agriculture to the ðŸŸ¢ department of education and establish a programmatic goal that at least ðŸŸ¡ thirty per cent of food served in public schools be ðŸŸ¡ locally sourced by ðŸŸ¡ 2030.

3. **Context Analysis**: Consider surrounding words

### Step 2: Entity Type Identification

#### **PROGRAM Entities**
- Look for: "program", "initiative", "project"
- Examples: "farm to school program", "meals program"
- Pattern: `[adjective] + [noun] + program`

#### **AGENCY Entities**
- Look for: "department", "agency", "bureau", acronyms
- Examples: "Department of Education", "HDOA", "DOE"
- Pattern: `Department of [Domain]` or `[ACRONYM]`

#### **GOAL Entities**
- Look for: percentages, years, targets
- Examples: "30%", "2030", "locally sourced"
- Pattern: `[number]%` or `[year]` or `[target phrase]`

#### **REPORTING Entities**
- Look for: "report", "submit", "requirement"
- Examples: "annual report", "reporting requirement"
- Pattern: `[frequency] + report` or `reporting + [noun]`

#### **STATUTE Entities**
- Look for: "chapter", "section", "H.B.", legal citations
- Examples: "Chapter 302A", "H.B. NO. 767"
- Pattern: `[Chapter/Section] + [number]` or `[H.B./S.B.] + NO. + [number]`

#### **PURPOSE Entities**
- Look for: infinitive verbs, objectives, goals
- Examples: "improve student health", "develop workforce"
- Pattern: `[verb] + [object]` (infinitive form)

### Step 3: Context Validation
1. **Surrounding Words**: Check if context supports entity type
2. **Grammatical Structure**: Verify entity fits sentence structure
3. **Domain Relevance**: Ensure entity is relevant to legislative domain

### Step 4: Confidence Scoring
- **High Confidence (0.9)**: Exact pattern matches, clear context
- **Medium Confidence (0.7-0.8)**: Good context, some ambiguity
- **Low Confidence (0.5-0.6)**: Weak context, possible false positive
