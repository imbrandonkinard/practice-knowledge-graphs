Currently, we are developing an ontology for a bill we would like to propose. In response to the CTAHR farm-to-school extension agent positions being cut in 2025 (30 Sept.), the Farm to School initiative put forth in Act 175, SLH 2021 has been impacted. Establishing a farm-to-school resource coordinator and one farm-to-school resource teacher per complex area would enable continued/sustained operation of agriculture curriculum in the existing schools and allow greater reach to new schools; support the continued development and facilitation of professional development courses for Hawaiʻi's educators; maintain the agriculture projects started through the SPROUTs grant with 63 ʻulu trees planted across 18 planting sites; etc(?).

I would like organizations to have the ability to query this ontology to help develop more informed bill drafts/proposals.

I would also like to be able to encode prior legislative reports (as expressed in my "todo.txt") from numerous food system organizations to be encoded and queried. 

Perhaps another empassioned mind will adopt this ontological approach to other domains. Energy, housing, development, etc.
